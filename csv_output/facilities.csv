The Yampa River multi-day rafting trips begin at Deerlodge Park. The Yampa rushes downstream 44-miles (71 km) to join the Green River at Echo Park. Boaters continue downstream on the Green River to the take-out at the Split Mountain boat ramp. The Yampa is the largest free-flowing tributary within the Colorado River system. As such, it has a shorter season marked by fluctuations in water level resulting from snow received in the winter. It is characterized by famous rapids such as Teepee, Big Joe and Warm Springs. Raft trips must be arranged in advance.

 Use of OHVs and ATVs is prohibited in Zion National Park.  <h2>Natural Features</h2>
Zion is known for its dynamic geologic history. The South Campground and Amphitheater were built by the Civilian Conservation Corp in the early 1930s. The project was completed and opened to the public in the spring of 1935. The Virgin River, a narrow but powerful river that has carved out the canyon over time, runs adjacent to the site. Cottonwood trees surrounding the campsite turn golden in the fall. Although the campground is moderately forested, most of the campsites are in partial to full sun but visitors can cool off in the cold river when temperatures peak during summer.     
    
Be Advised: The months of April and May bring an unusual infestation of Tent Caterpillars, which fall from trees onto tents, tables, and unsuspecting campers and can make it quite uncomfortable to sit outside. The months of July and August in particular bring a higher concentration of ants in the campsites, which seem to come out especially after the monsoons, but are present all summer long. August and September bring yellowjackets. Insecticidal treatment by visitors is not permitted.

The BLM closed the Little Sahara Recreation Area (LSRA) on March 26, after working closely with state and local governments to address public health concerns related to COVID-19. This closure is also consistent with the State Public Health Order issued by the Utah Department of Health. The closure is effective immediately and will remain in effect until such time as conditions allow for safe use of the recreation area. The BLM’s number one priority is to protect the health and safety of staff and visitors to our recreation areas and facilities.  <p/>


The BLM continues to collaborate with state and local governments to plan and implement the closure and to help reduce the potential spread of COVID-19. On busy weekends in the spring, LSRA may receive up to 30,000 visitors, large camping groups, heavy use of public facilities, and significant employee-public contact. During the weekend of March 20-22, the LSRA received approximately 15,000 visitors.<p/>

Just keep a look out for the big four legged types that have the right-of-way! 

From the Grapevine Trailhead, at the western terminus, start with a good warm up on the Grapevine Trail. Note that the Grapevine Trail is used by government vehicles to service the wells in the area. Follow the road uphill to the junction with the single track Prospector Trail on the right. From here to the Cottonwood Trailhead the terrain is diverse and varies from packed, non-technical trail, to more challenging deep sandy washes, a few steep rocky hills, and bit of slick rock. 

From the Cottonwood Trailhead, you can continue on the northeastern most section of trail to the White Reef Trailhead. This section is the easiest, with mostly packed trail, a few sandy sections and hills.

If beginning at the White Reef Trailhead, take White Reef Trail from the trailhead for 0.2 miles.  Turn left onto Adams Trail and follow it until reaching a “Y” intersection.  At this point the trail splits for users.  Equestrians should go left to the low water crossing over Quail Creek, while hikers should go right to cross Quail Creek over a small, narrow pedestrian bridge.  The trail reconnects on the other side of the creek.  Turn right at the next intersection, which is the start of the Prospector Trail.

Views of the Pine Valley Mountains and the red sandstone cliffs of Cottonwood Canyon Wilderness grace the whole extent of this area.

The ""logs"" were formed when a lava flow cooled into orderly columnar joints having 3 to 6 sides. The columns measure about a foot in diameter and up to 15 feet in length.

This formation was on the rim of the caldera that collapsed due to a void left when lava flowed out from under the caldera. Basin and range faulting caused the formation to tilt onto its side. Erosion has exposed the formation we now see.","Paul Bunyan's Woodpile is located just east of Hwy 6, near Jericho Junction (the access road to Little Sahara Recreation Area).

The fins are located on top of the ridge to the left as you hike up canyon. The fins are composed of lava ""logs"" that look as if they were neatly stacked. Other logs are strewn haphazardly around the ridge top.

When you can see the fins clearly, look for a trail that leaves the draw and switchbacks up the side of the ridge to the woodpile.

<ul>
	<li>The Red Reef Trail follows the Quail Creek drainage as it enters the <a href=""https://www.blm.gov/visit/cottonwood-canyon-wilderness"" rel=""nofollow"">Cottonwood Canyon Wilderness</a> and then passes into the Cottonwood Forest Wilderness of the Dixie National Forest. Ten of thousands of visitors hike this first 0.6-mile section of trail each spring when snowmelt from the Pine Valley Mountains creates short cascades of water that pools in slickrock bowls of the beautiful red Navajo Sandstone.</li>
	<li>To continue beyond this popular destination, hikers must use a series of small toe holds carved into the sandstone to ascend this first obstacle. After 0.4 miles the route will leave the Quail Creek drainage and enter a side canyon on the left. </li>

<p>For visitors to Zion National Park, Watchman Campground is an ideal place to stay. Located near the park's south entrance, the campground is just a short walk from the main visitor center, the Zion Canyon Shuttle System and the adjacent town of Springdale. The canyon and most of the park's trails are only accessible by shuttle bus from approximately March through November each year. <br></p>
<p><strong>Season Dates:</strong> Watchman Campground is open year-round. Reservations are available 6 months in advance. </p>
<h2>Recreation</h2>
  
Hikers can access three trails directly from the facility: the Watchman Trail, a moderate trail that ascends the peak behind the campground; the Archeology Trail, which offers a light hike to an archeological site nearby; and the Pa'rus Trail, a paved walking and biking trail that runs alongside the river, and the only trail in the park that allows dogs. 

Although there are no rock climbing routes in the campground, many popular climbs are within a short shuttle bus ride into the main canyon.

Use of OHVs and ATVs is prohibited in Zion National Park. <h2>Facilities</h2>

Use of OHVs and ATVs is prohibited in Zion National Park. <h2>Natural Features</h2>
Zion is known for it's dynamic geologic history and Watchman Campground is no exception. Named for the rocky peak that rises above it,  the campground is surrounded by tall sandstone cliffs that glow red and orange during sunrise and sunset.  The Virgin River, a narrow but powerful river that has carved out the canyon over time, runs adjacent to the campground.  Cottonwood trees surrounding the campsite turn golden in the fall. Most of the campsites are in partial to full sun, however in the Group sites (E-Loop) and the Walk-To sites (F-Loop) visitors may receive some shade under pergulas that are constructed over the picnic tables.  Visitors can also cool off in the cold river when temperatures peak during summer.   
Be Advised:  The months of April and May bring an unusual infestation of Tent Caterpillars, which fall from trees onto tents, tables, and unsuspecting campers and can make it quite uncomfortable to sit outside. The months of July and August in particular bring a higher concentration of ants in the campsites, which seem to come out especially after the monsoons, but are present all summer long. Insecticidal treatment by visitors is not permitted.
<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>
 The town of Springdale has shopping, art galleries, restaurants, and a public library. Throughout the year, concerts, festivals, and parades are held in the town.

The Yampa River multi-day rafting trips begin at Deerlodge Park. The Yampa rushes downstream 44-miles (71 km) to join the Green River at Echo Park. Boaters continue downstream on the Green River to the take-out at the Split Mountain boat ramp. The Yampa is the largest free-flowing tributary within the Colorado River system.

Singletrack trail. 3.15 miles in length. Difficulty: Difficult. This trail is rated difficult for its length (remember to add 1.8 miles if starting from Hurricane Hills Trailhead), exposure to steep drop-offs, narrow widths, and steep grades. Only hikers are allowed on the trail as a mix of users is incompatible due to the previously mentions issues. A perfect example of the rugged nature of the trail is “The Drop”, a steep narrow passage with large lava rocks and boulders lining the way.  Beginning at .3 miles (from the Hurricane Hills Trailhead) the trail “drops” steeply from the mesa top to the bench where a historical water canal was constructed. It continues to wind across a steep side slope, pressing against the cliff face, and leaving only a narrow pathway.Twelve tunnels were originally built along the canal through solid rock. Three are included in this trail, but one is closed for safety. You can walk through two of the tunnels, but be sure to bring a flashlight, as the longest is about 40 feet long and pitch black in the center on even the brightest of days. There are also tunnel ‘bypasses’ for those who aren’t so keen on confined spaces. You will also come across a short bridge made of planks of wood, and a couple of names etched in stone dating from the 1980s. There are several interpretive panels along the way to enlighten you on the trails past. The history of the canal is fascinating. Diverting water from the Virgin River, 7 miles away, was first envisioned by two men in 1893: James Jepson and John Steele, but it was accomplished through the motivation of entire communities. What we see today is the achievement of what seemed like an impossible task, accomplished mainly by determined citizens of neighboring communities. The residents were farmers dealing with flooding, and desperately needed more cultivable land. They spent their summers farming and their winters working on the canal with just hand-powered tools. By 1902 only eight to ten men were left working on the canal.  After an influx of money from the Salt Lake City LDS church, the canal was completed two years later, and water flowed onto the Hurricane Bench on August 6,1904, generating 2,000 acres of fertile land. NOTE: There has been recent rockfall on some sections of the trail (2011); some scrambling is required; use caution.","Hurricane Hills Trailhead—From Interstate 15 Exit 16, head east on State Route 9 to Hurricane City for 9.5 miles.

Blacksmith Fork Guard Station is located in the Cache National Forest, approximately 11 miles east of Hyrum, in northern Utah. The Guard Station was constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps in 1934 as part of the New Deal Program. Early Forest Service stations were typically spaced a ""days ride by horseback"" from each other. The Uinta-Wasatch-Cache National Forests has decided to rent the cabin to the public so visitors can enjoy a rustic experience similar to that of early Forest Rangers and their families.

Umpqua National Forest visitors are often taken aback by unique and surprising landscapes shaped by explosive geologic events. The 984,602-acre forest provides spectacular scenery and an abundance of natural and cultural resources.  The translation of the word, ""Umpqua,"" meaning ""thundering waters,"" defines the area. High mountain lakes, heart-stopping rapids, peaceful ponds and thundering waterfalls, including the 272-foot Watson Falls on the North Umpqua Highway, offer visitors a renewed sense of spirit.   

Diverse ecosystems support a wide range of habitat for wildlife. From eagles and owls to salamanders and salmon, these species, along with many others, depend on surrounding undeveloped wilderness, clean streams and diverse forests to live.

<br/><br/>

Quail Prairie Lookout offers guests a unique lodging experience in the Rogue-Siskiyou National Forest in western Oregon. On a clear day, visitors are treated to spectacular views of the Kalmiopsis Wilderness from the top of the 41-foot tower.<br/><br/>
The tower was completed in 1963 and served as one of the last lookouts built by the southwestern Oregon Forest Service until the mid 1990's, when it was converted for recreational purposes.
<br/><br/>
Today campers can enjoy a unique lodging experience in the historic structure, which offers basic amenities and spectacular views of the surrounding area. Although the facility provides basic amenities, guests must bring a few of their own supplies to ensure a safe and comfortable stay.<h2>Recreation</h2>
The nearby Upper Chetco Trail is the main east/west route through the Kalmiopsis Wilderness. It offers access to the Chetco River and two main tributaries. Heavy vegetation provides shade but eliminates most views, and at least three significant long and steep sections provide a challenging backpacking experience.
<br/><br/> 
Anglers will enjoy the remote location and scenic backdrop of the nearby Chetco River, providing angling opportunities for trout, steelhead, and salmon in season. The Chetco starts in steep, deeply dissected, sparsely vegetated, mountainous terrain within the Kalmiopsis Wilderness.
<br/><br/> 
At night the lookout is an ideal setting for stargazing, as constellations and planets put on a dazzling display.<h2>Facilities</h2>

Located on the crest of the Warner Mountain Range at an elevation of 8,222 feet, Drake Peak Lookout hugs the wind-swept land surrounding it, offering unparalleled views into Oregon, California and Nevada. The lookout was built in 1948 and has served as a fire detection site for the surrounding area. 
<br/><br/>
Historically, Forest Service personnel lived long seasons in the cabin, scanning the region for lightning, flames, curls of smoke or any other indicator of possible forest fires. At one time, hundreds of these types of lookouts were in service throughout the Pacific Northwest. Today the lookout provides a unique lodging experience for guests seeking recreation and relaxation in the Fremont-Winema National Forest.<br/><br/>

The Tilly Jane A-Frame is an ideal getaway for individuals, groups and families who enjoy the great outdoors in the beautiful Pacific Northwest.  The facility is one of the oldest structures on Mt. Hood and is a popular cabin used by winter recreationists. Peak season for use of the cabin is usually November through June.. It provides access to scenic terrain, specifically hiking, snowshoeing and backcountry skiing activities.
<br/><br/>
During the summer months (usually July-September) the A-Frame is easily accessed by taking a short quarter mile walk through the Tilly Jane Campground. During the winter months ( October-June), it serves as a winter retreat for persons hardy enough to make the effort to get to the cabin from the Tilly Jane Sno-Park. Winter conditions often exist for nine months of the year.  Visitors can ski to the cabin following a 9 mile gently sloping road or climb the historic Tilly Jane ski trail which is roughly 2.7 miles, with an elevation gain of 1,900 feet.  Skis or snowshoes are highly recommended!
<br/><br/>
Guests are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety.  Backcountry travel experience is highly recommended.<h2>Recreation</h2>
Visitors must hike, snowshoe or ski to the facility during the winter months.  During the summer season, it is possible to drive up and walk to the structure.  Multiple trails can be accessed from the A-Frame, some of which are well marked and others covered by snow for most of the year.
  
Nearby trails offer a variety of day trips, including to the Cooper Spur Stone shelter which offers great views of the majestic Mt. Hood, St Helens, Mt. Adams and Mt. Rainer.<h2>Facilities</h2>
The 24-by-48, two story structure has a sleeping loft, accessed by a ladder that can accommodate up to 20 people.  More than one group may reserve the facility at the same time.  It is equipped with two picnic tables, benches, a few chairs and a wood stove for heating and boiling/melting snow.
<br/><br/> 
In warmer months, water can be found with a short walk to Tilly Creek.  We advise that all water be treated or boiled.  In winter, water can be obtained by digging an access hole to Tilly Creek or by melting snow using the pots provided at the cabin.  A primitive outhouse with a pit toilet is provided within the alcove of the structure.  You will need to bring your own toilet paper.
<br/><br/>
Guests will also need to provide sleeping bags and pads, warm clothing, headlamps, cooking pots/pans, stove and fuel, matches or a lighter.  It is best to treat your stay as a backpacking trip, bringing everything you'd need minus a tent.  Several lanterns and replacement mantels are available.  You will need to provide the one pound green propane canisters if you wish to use the lanterns.  Firewood and splitting tools are provided.<h2>Natural Features</h2>
The A-Frame is located high on the north side of Mt. Hood at an elevation of 5,700 feet.  It is one of five structures within the Cloud Cap/Tilly Jane Historic District.  It was built in the late 1930s by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) and was used extensively by the American Legion in its early days.  The facility is surrounded by old growth trees and is roughly 1,000 feet below tree line.  It is operated and maintained by the all-volunteer, Oregon Nordic Club, under permit from the Forest Service.  A cook shed is adjacent to the A-Frame, but has been condemned by the Forest Service.","From Hood River, OR -- South on Hwy 35 for 8.5 miles, past the Hood River Ranger Station.

Musick Guard Station is located in a remote setting in southwestern Oregon, offering visitors a glimpse into a historic mining community in Umpqua National Forest. Situated atop a narrow forested ridge between Fairview Peak and Grouse Mountain, the guard station and outbuildings were constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps in 1934 to provide fire protection to the Bohemia Mining district.    

Listed on the National Register of Historic Places, Musick Guard Station became an important public contact point and administrative center for the Forest Service. Later it was used as summer barracks for trail crews and firefighting crews. The Guard Station was named after the nearby Musick Mine, a major gold producing mine in the late 1800s and early 1900s.  

Today the guard station continues to offer visitors a unique lodging experience and plenty of opportunities for relaxation and recreation.  

This site is located in National Forest System lands. These sites are popular with the recreating public so you may find visitors interested in the area and the facilities. While you do not have to let them inside the facility they are allowed to be in the area.<h2>Recreation</h2>
For hiking and sightseeing, the nearby Bohemia Mountain Trail leads up a steep grade to the rocky summit of Bohemia Mountain, the highest point on the Cottage Grove Ranger District. Just east of the summit along a ridgeline hikers will be treated to dramatic views of the Cascade mountains and a wildflowers blooming along rocky outcrops and bluffs in late June through early August.  


For history buffs and fortune seekers, Musick Mine, one of the most productive gold mines in the district during the late 1800s and into the early 1900s, is a point of interest not to be overlooked. The area is named after James ""Bohemia"" Johnson, a mountaineer and prospector, who discovered gold-bearing quartz in 1863. The discovery created much short-lived excitement in the valley, but settlers soon realized the gold had to be extracted from the rock by machinery, not panned from the many streambeds, and by 1910 most of the ore had been removed. Some mining continues today.<h2>Facilities</h2>

Looking up on the hillside, one can see white markers planted to mark the actual routes as they descend the hillside.

Depending on the time of year one views the crossing, the river’s volume of water can look quite ominous.

Perched atop Pickett Butte at an elevation of 3,200 feet, this lookout offers visitors a unique lodging experience in Umpqua National Forest in southwest Oregon.  

After climbing 40 feet up on a very narrow steep stairway to the one-room structure, guests are rewarded with panoramic views of the entire Jackson Creek Drainage and much of the lower elevation lands around the town of Tiller.  

The original lookout was 25 feet tall and built in 1934. In 1948 the tower was replaced with the current flat top structure.  

The tower is available for reservations October 15 through July 15 (lookout is utilized for fire season during the summer months). The roads to the lookout are not plowed, nor are they maintained for passenger cars. High clearance or four wheel drive vehicles are recommended for travel to this site, and guests must bring several of their own amenities. Please be aware that while very uncommon, during winter months guests may need to snowmobile, ski or snowshoe up to four miles to reach the lookout. <h2>Recreation</h2>
Hiking, birding and wildlife viewing are popular among guests. Seasonal changes envelope the area as snowmelt gives rise to spring flowers and vivid autumn colors welcome a landscape dusted with snow.  

Guests may enjoy a day of scenic driving along a portion of the 172-miles Rogue-Umpqua National Scenic Byway. Mountain and river scenery unfold along the highway, showcasing everything from rolling oak-covered hills and towering coniferous forests to roaring white water rapids and incised inter-canyon lava flows.   

Swimming at the Three C Rock Picnic Area, about 7 miles from the lookout, is also a refreshing way to spend a warm summer afternoon.

Lake Harriet Campground sits on the eastern shores of crystal clear Lake Harriet. It is located between the Oak Grove Fork of the Clackamas River, which flows into the lake, and the nearby forest highway. It is a great location for camping, fishing and boating.
<h2>Recreation</h2>
Boating, canoeing and fishing on Lake Harriet are popular activities. There is a speed limit of 10 mph. The lake is stocked with rainbow trout each year, resulting in easy fly fishing. Anglers can also expect to catch cutthroat and brown trout, which spawn in the nearby river. The campground offers a boat ramp and fishing dock for easy lake access.
The nearby Oak Grove Fork of Clackamas River is also popular for fishing. Steelhead, chinook and kokanee salmon can often be caught there. Further down the river, the Clackamas provides class III-IV whitewater rafting. The river provides a perfect habitat for the bald eagle and northern spotted owl, as well as an occasional peregrine falcon.
Visitors can also enjoy hiking in the Bull of the Woods Wilderness area, just south of the campground. Several primitive forest roads nearby are useful for mountain biking and the Cascades Scenic Byway, which follows the Clackamas River, runs near the campground.<h2>Facilities</h2>

Warner Mountain Lookout is the winter wonderland destination for avid winter sports enthusiasts looking for a challenge. This replica of an old cupola-style lookout 
sits on a high vantage point of Warner Ridge at an altitude of 5,300 feet in the Willamette National Forest approximately 75 miles southeast of Eugene, Oregon.<br/><br/> 

This is a very remote location; the road to the lookout is not plowed or maintained for winter travel. The lookout can only be accessed by skis, snowmobiles or snowshoes, a distance of 2-10 miles. Conditions on the mountain change rapidly. You need to be evaluating conditions and weather throughout your stay. Sudden storms and high winds may make skiing and driving conditions difficult. Experience in cross-country skiing or snowshoe travel is highly recommended. Guests are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety, and must bring several of their own amenities.<br/><br/>

The reward is worth the effort of getting there. Guests will enjoy panoramic views of the pristine snow-covered landscape and starry skies on clear nights.<h2>Recreation</h2>
Winter recreationists can enjoy cross-country skiing, snowshoeing and snowmobiling on the terrain in the nearby Middle Fork Willamette River - Moon Point Trail Area.<br/><br/>

Miner's Retreat is an old Forest Service cabin that allows guests to relax in the outdoors and also step back in time to when the cabin was used during the bygone gold mining days. Miner's Retreat is part of the Fremont Powerhouse complex, a hub for mining built in the early 1900s. It is one of four cabins located at the site near the town of Granite, and provides great flexibility for larger groups.
<br/><br/>
The surrounding valleys once teemed with mining activity, primarily gold. The Fremont Powerhouse was built in 1908 as an economical method for mining. Two dams were constructed at Olive Lake, and water from the lake was piped through an 8-mile wood and steel pipeline to the powerhouse to generate electricity. Homes were constructed to shelter workers who monitored the pipeline. Today, these same shelters are where visitors can stay overnight.
<br/><br/>
The cabin is uphill from the Fremont Powerhouse, flanked by Caretakers Cabin and Hilltop Hideaway. Winter access may require skis, snowshoes or snowmobiles.<br/><br/>

The unique character of the landscapes comprising the area has led to the designation of over 340,000 acres of the forest as wilderness, and over 200 miles of streams as National Wild and Scenic Rivers.<br/><br/>

The forest itself is composed of two distinct geological provinces, the Cascade Range and the Siskiyou Mountains. The Cascade Range is dominated by snow-capped volcanic peaks like the 9,495-foot Mt. McLoughlin, located within the Sky Lakes Wilderness. 
<br/><br/> 
The Siskiyou area embodies the most complex and treasured plant communities in the Pacific Northwest. World-class wild rivers, biological diversity, remarkable fisheries and complex watersheds all define the Siskiyou.<br/><br/> 

Diverse landscapes provide habitat for a wide range of wildlife, from spotted owls and bull elk to salamanders and sandhill cranes.

The unique character of the landscapes comprising the Rogue River-Siskiyou National Forest has led to the designation of over 340,000 acres of the forest as Wilderness, and over 200 miles of streams as National Wild and Scenic Rivers.<br/><br/>

The forest itself is composed of two distinct geological provinces, the Cascade Range and the Siskiyou Mountains.<br/><br/> 

The Cascade Range is dominated by snow-capped volcanic peaks, such as 9,495 foot Mt. McLoughlin, located within the Sky Lakes Wilderness. The Siskiyou area embodies the most complex and treasured plant communities in the Pacific Northwest. World-class wild rivers, biological diversity, remarkable fisheries resources and complex watersheds define the Siskiyou.<br/><br/> 

Diverse landscapes provide habitat for a wide-range of wildlife, from spotted owls and bull elk to salamanders and sandhill cranes.

The Ludlum House is situated at the base of a mixed-conifer forest at the confluence of Wheeler Creek and the Winchuck River in southwestern Oregon, offering guests a unique setting for recreation and relaxation.<br/><br/>
The house was rebuilt in 1999 as a near-replica of the original two-story Ludlum family vacation house. Mr. Ludlum, an oil-company executive, constructed the house in 1939, then sold the property to the Forest Service following World War II.
<br/><br/>
The accessible home offers some of the amenities needed for a comfortable lodging experience, although guests will need to bring several of their own supplies to ensure a safe and enjoyable stay. <h2>Recreation</h2>
Hiking, wildlife viewing and fishing top the list of recreational opportunities in the area surrounding the Ludlum House.
<br/><br/> 
Just steps away from the banks of the Winchuck River, the cabin provides fantastic fishing opportunities for Coho salmon, Chinook salmon, cutthroat trout and steelhead trout. The river is closed to fishing above the Wheeler Creek confluence to provide a refuge for wild fish, but anglers will some excellent steelhead waters below this point, including several miles on the Rogue River-Siskiyou National Forest. Standard winter steelhead tactics such as drift fishing, floating jigs, or swinging flies work well on this gravel and cobble-bottomed river. Flies such as spruce flies or bucktail streamers work well for sea-run cutthroat.<br/><br/> 
The Oregon Redwoods Trail provides a unique accessible hiking opportunity through a grove of majestic old-growth redwood trees. Guests will have the opportunity to learn about old-growth tree ecology, fire history, wildlife, and botany in the area along Peavine Ridge in the Winchuck River drainage.
<br/><br/>
Redwood trees in this area represent the only coastal redwoods found in the Pacific Northwest Region, located at the limit of their northern range. The trail is an out/back design with a short loop at the far end, where a picnic stop is provided. A short wooden deck provides access to the inside of a hollowed redwood tree.<h2>Facilities</h2>

Five major tributaries, Wheeler Creek, East Fork, Fourth of July Creek, Bear Creek and South Fork, make up the Winchuck River system. Mt. Emily, at 2,926 feet, is the highest point in the basin.
<br/><br/> 
Diverse landscapes provide habitat for a wide-range of wildlife, including black-tailed deer and an occasional black bear, to squirrels and salmon. Sensitive wildlife species such as Spotted Owl and Marbled Murrelet are present in the watershed as well. These species, along with many others, depend on the surrounding undeveloped wilderness, undisturbed wetlands, clean streams, and diverse forests to live.","From Portland OR, follow 1-5S to US 199S to Brookings.

Congo Gulch is an old Forest Service cabin that allows guests to relax in the outdoors and step back in time to when the cabin was used during bygone gold mining days. It is part of the Fremont Powerhouse complex, a hub for mining built in the early 1900s. As one of four cabins located at the site, the cabin offers flexibility for large groups. Guests can rent all cabins and also pitch tents in the grassy yard. 
  
The surrounding valleys once teemed with mining activity, primarily gold. The Fremont Powerhouse was built in 1908 as an economical method for mining. Two dams were constructed at Olive Lake, and water from the lake was piped through an 8-mile wood and steel pipeline to the powerhouse to generate electricity. Homes were constructed to shelter workers who monitored the pipeline. Today, these same shelters are available as recreational rentals.
  
Congo Gulch is named for the small creek that runs beside the property. Winter access may require skis, snowshoes or snowmobiles.<h2>Recreation</h2>

Caretaker's Cabin allows guests to relax in the outdoors at the historic Fremont Powerhouse site.  As one of four cabins located at the site, the cabin offers flexibility for large groups, like weddings or reunions. Guests can rent all cabins (see Congo Gulch, Hilltop Hideaway, and Miner's Retreat) and also pitch tents in the grassy yard. Caretaker’s Cabin sits on a hill beside Miner’s Retreat and has parking access beside it. The cabin can accommodate up to 10 guests. Winter access may require skis, snowshoes or snowmobiles. 
In the 1800s, the North Fork John Day drainage was bustling with gold and silver mining.  Around 1903, local mines began to notice a decline in earnings and promoted construction of a cheaper power source in an effort to operate the mines more economically.  As a result, the Fremont Powerhouse was constructed and began operation in 1908. Two dams were constructed at Olive Lake and water from the lake was piped through an eight-mile-long wood and steel pipeline to the powerhouse to generate the much-needed electrical power. The Caretaker’s Cabin house was constructed in the 1930s to shelter workers who monitored the pipeline for leaks and kept the powerhouse operating.  The entire site and pipeline are listed as an historic district on the National Register of Historic Places. <h2>Recreation</h2>
 Guests can hike on North Fork John Day Wilderness trails or go mountain biking on forest roads. A drive along the Blue Mountain Scenic Byway is a treat, as are activities like huckleberry and mushroom picking, bird watching, wildlife viewing and photographing the vast landscape. Nearby Olive Lake offers boating, fishing and swimming.<h2>Facilities</h2>

Perched atop the edge of a rocky cliff in the Umpqua National Forest, Acker Rock Lookout offers visitors a unique lodging experience with spectacular panoramic views of the South Umpqua watershed in southwest Oregon.   

Still used in active fire detection today, the lookout was placed on the rocky cliff via helicopter in the 1960's. Before the advent of airplane surveillance for fire detection, there were more than a dozen lookouts on the Tiller Ranger District. Today Acker Rock and Pickett Butte are the only remaining lookouts on the District.  

The lookout tower is generally available for reservation from August 1st thru November 15th (depending on snow).  High clearance all-terrain vehicles are recommended for travel to this site, and guests must bring several of their own amenities.  The lookout is not rented during the winter months due to wind and snow weight restrictions on the building.  



Visitors should keep in mind everything must be packed in via a moderately steep 0.4-mile hike along a forested trail to reach the lookout.<h2>Recreation</h2>
The panorama includes landmarks on the Rogue-Umpqua Divide; on a clear day you can see mountains on the Willamette, Rogue, and Deschutes River watersheds and Crater Lake Rim.  Overlooking the Umpqua River and several of its tributaries, the lookout is a delightful setting for hiking, birding and wildlife viewing.  Seasonal changes envelope the area as snowmelt gives rise to spring flowers and vivid autumn colors bring with it numerous recreation opportunities.
<br/><br/>

For a day trip, guests may enjoy a scenic drive along a portion of the 172-mile Rogue-Umpqua National Scenic Byway or a mountain hike into the Rogue Umpqua Divide wilderness on over 100 miles of trail.<h2>Facilities</h2>

Bald Butte Lookout is perched atop the windy summit of Bald Butte in the Fremont-Winema National Forest in south-central Oregon. It is surrounded by forested hillsides and expansive views.<br/><br/>

The lookout was built in 1931 and served as a Forest Service fire detection site for over 50 years. It was constructed from an Aladdin L4 ground-mounted lookout kit in which all of the pieces were pre-cut in six-foot lengths or less so the entire kit could be packed by horses into the remote site. The total cost of the structure at the time was $668.49 and only took a few days to assemble.<br/><br/>

At one time, hundreds of these types of lookouts were in service throughout the Pacific Northwest. Today only two such structures remain in Oregon, providing a unique lodging experience for guests seeking recreation and relaxation.<br/><br/>

The lookout offers basic amenities, though for guests to enjoy their experience completely, they must bring several of their own supplies.<h2>Recreation</h2>

The scenery surrounding the campground alternates between thick Ponderosa pine forests and grassy meadows, though shortly beyond the campground the road descends into lower-elevation, arid canyon lands. <br/><br/>One of the most unique geologic features of the Ochoco National Forest is the 'thunder egg,' Oregon's official state rock. Thunder eggs are small, colorful, round volcanic rocks similar to geodes that have been exposed over time. The U.S. Forest Service has designated specific sites for rock hounding.

Peavy Cabin was built in 1934 by Dr. George Wilcox Peavy, Dean of the School of Forestry at Oregon Agricultural College (later Oregon State University). The facility was used as his outdoor laboratory to instruct forestry students. 
<br/><br/>
The cabin was then turned over to the Forest Service and used as a guard station. Several restoration projects have kept the integrity and charm of this historic structure, which is now recorded in the Heritage Resource Inventory as a historic site.
<br/><br/>
This cabin is available from July 1 until October 31 and is accessible via an unpaved road. High clearance and 4-wheel drive vehicles are recommended. Guests must bring some of their own supplies; however, Peavy Cabin does offers few modern conveniences to make for a comfortable stay.<h2>Recreation</h2>

It is a classic example of forest structures of that era and is eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places. It was used by forest fireguards who would ride their horses deep into the forest’s interior to look for wisps of smoke from lightning strikes or to check on communications lines along Forest Service roads. It became a recreation rental in 1997.</p>

<h2>Know Before You Go:</h2> <ul><li> The Soldier Creek Loop Road can be impassable when wet or muddy, so plan accordingly. It is designated a BLM Watchable Wildlife road, and is enjoyed by a variety of users – including outdoor enthusiasts, birders, ranchers, upland bird and big game hunters, rafters, and campers. Cattle graze on the open range here, too, so be prepared for the occasional cow-in-the-road experience.  </li>
<li> Along the way, plan a stop at the Owyhee Canyon Overlook (22 miles from the highway turn-off) for breathtaking views of the Owyhee Wild and Scenic River far below. </li>
<li> The last two miles to the site drop quickly into the Three Forks canyon. It is best to stop at the canyon rim and assess the road conditions before attempting the descent with your vehicle, as it’s rocky, steep, and not regularly maintained. Visitors are encouraged to park their cars at the rim and hike down to the site, should driving conditions be too treacherous.</li>
<li> Once in the canyon, the recreation site features five designated campsites, a boat launch, vehicle parking, and vault restrooms. </li>
<li> The site is named Three Forks for the three sections of rivers – the Owyhee, the North Fork Owyhee, and the Middle Fork Owyhee – that converge in the area. </li>
<li> Pronghorn antelope can be found on the rangeland above the canyon, and the canyon interior is particularly important as mule deer winter range habitat. Elk also use this area in the winter and California Bighorn sheep are year-round residents within the Owyhee River corridor.</li></ul>

<h2>Point of Interest:</h2>Remnants of a historic military road can still be seen today, zig-zagging up the canyon’s west face, and old wagon and ranching roads near the recreation site allow for hiking and walking in the area.","Getting there is a challenge, but it’s worth the effort.

Box Canyon Guard Station sits beneath a canopy of Douglas fir at an altitude of 3,620 feet on the West Cascades National Scenic Byway. It is located approximately 75 miles southeast of Eugene, Oregon in the Willamette National Forest.   

The guard station was built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in 1933 and used as a dwelling for fire guards. They were the smoke chasers, often riding on horseback through the tall timbers to the location spotted by the lookout tower guards. The first on the scene, they often tried to put out any fires they may have found on their own, or reported back for additional help.   

The guard station is open from early May through the end of October and is easily accessible by car. Some creature comforts are provided, but guests should be prepared to pack in most of their own supplies and gear.  <h2>Recreation</h2>

Antlers Guard Station was built in 1935 for the fire crews who patrolled Wallowa-Whitman National Forest. The Forest Roads were not yet well developed, and it was impractical for crews to travel daily between the remote parts of the forest and the ranger station. The Civilian Conservation Corps built this structure to allow crews to stay where they worked. Antlers Guard Station was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991.

Hemlock Butte Cabin is a very primitive backcountry winter experience, and guests who stay here should be experienced in winter backcountry travel. It is this remoteness that makes the 4-mile ski or snowshoe to the cabin worth the effort.  

The cabin was built by the Edelweiss Ski Club in 1990 and has room for 12 people. There are often occupants from several different groups staying in the cabin at the same time. Only a few basic amenities are offered, so guests should be prepared to pack in most of their own supplies and gear.<h2>Recreation</h2>
Several winter recreation trails crisscross the area. The Hemlock Butte Trail, which is used to access the cabin, is a challenging backcountry ski experience. Skiers on this trail can enjoy views of Mount Thielsen, Mount Bailey and even the rim of Crater Lake on a clear day.  

Advanced skiers can make the difficult trek up Mount Bailey, a 2-mile trip from the cabin with an elevation gain of 3,300 feet.  

Skiers should make sure to have proper backcountry equipment and be aware of  avalanche dangers .<h2>Facilities</h2>
The cabin is a three-story A-frame with a wood stove for heating the cabin and melting snow. The ground floor serves as the living area with benches around the stove. The middle floor is the sleeping area. The top floor is available for additional sleeping space via a wall-mounted ladder. The only provided cooking pot is for melting snow.   

Firewood is provided through Edelweiss Ski Club volunteers and U.S. Forest Service staff, but guests are asked to use it conservatively. An outhouse with vault toilet is located near the cabin.   

No electricity or drinking water is provided. Guests typically melt snow to use for drinking, cooking and washing. The cabin does not have beds.  

Guests should bring sleeping bags and pads, a camp stove, cookware and utensils, lanterns or flashlights, a first aid kit, matches, extra toilet paper and garbage bags. All trash and food should be packed out, and guests are expected to clean the cabin before leaving.<h2>Natural Features</h2>
The cabin is situated at the base of Southern Oregon's Mount Bailey in Umpqua National Forest, near scenic Diamond Lake. Mount Bailey is a popular ski destination, averaging 600 inches of snow per year and boasting 6,000 acres of ideal skiing terrain.   

Mount Bailey, part of the Cascade Mountain Range, is a shield volcano topped with a 2,000-foot tephra cone. The mountain is heavily forested with pine at lower elevations, which gives way to hemlock and fir at higher elevations. The peak rises above treeline and crests at 8,363 feet.<h2>Charges & Cancellations</h2>
