The Princess Trail offers an alpine ridge experience with commanding 360 degree views. Due to this trail’s alpine nature, snow may linger well into June. Use caution accessing trailheads within the Vinegar Hills as forest roads in this area are predominantly narrow, steep, and rugged.</p>

4,AUTO TOURING,"<p>Two Scenic Byways follow the path of the Klamath.  The State of Jefferson Scenic Byway follows Hwy 96 from I-5 to Happy Camp and the Bigfoot Scenic Byway goes from Happy Camp along Hwy 96 to Willow Creek.  Several river access areas offer opportunities along the way to picnic, fish, gold pan and water play.</p>",234956
9,CAMPING,"<p>There are four campgrounds with access to the Klamath River:  Tree of Heaven, Sarah Totten, Fort Goff and Curley Jack.  Sarah Totten and Curley Jack also offer Group Camping.  There are no hook-ups for RV's, no showers and all toilets are vault style.  All four have drinking water and garbage collection in the summer.  A bulletin Board at the camp entrance will explain the procedures for paying fees and campground rules and regulations.  Sarah Totten, Tree of Heaven and Curley Jack have some barrier free facilities to accommodate a person in a wheelchair.</p>",234956
14,HIKING,"<p>There are hundreds of miles of trails beginning at the Klamath River or starting nearby.  For a map of all trails on the Klamath National Forest stop by one of our <a href=""http://fs.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsinternet/!ut/p/c4/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP0os3gjAwhwtDDw9_AI8zPyhQoY6BdkOyoCAGixyPg!/?ss=110505&navtype=BROWSEBYSUBJECT&cid=FSE_003828&navid=170120000000000&pnavid=170000000000000&position=BROWSEBYSUBJECT&ttype=detail&pname=Klamath%20National%20Forest-%20Offices"" rel=""nofollow"">Forest Service Offices</a> or order by mail at the <a href=""http://www.nationalforeststore.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">National Forest Store</a>.  A good map, compass and trail guide are recommended for safe travel through the forest and the wilderness.</p>
<p> </p>",234956
20,PICNICKING,<p>There is nothing better than a picnic along the river.  Plan ahead to store and remove all trash and garbage from your picnic site.  Some river access areas have picnic tables.</p>,234956
23,RECREATIONAL VEHICLES,<p>RV camping is popular both at developed campgrounds and dispersed throughout the forest.  There are no RV hook-ups at Forest Service areas on the Klamath National Forest.  Several RV parks are available with hook-ups in the communities along the river. </p>,234956
26,WILDLIFE VIEWING,"<p>The Klamath River Corridor provides food, water and shelter for a wide variety of wildlife.  River otters, elk and deer, birds of prey, ducks and geese, racoons, squirrels and bears all make their homes on or around the Klamath River.  When you visit their home please remember some basic good manners:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Feeding wild animals is dangerous to humans and unhealthy for the animals.</li>
    <li>Always observe animals and birds from a distance, both for your safety and their comfort.</li>
    <li>Dogs on leash only. Please clean up after your dog.</li>
    <li>Do not allow dogs to chase, hunt or kill forest animals and birds.</li>
    <li>Please pack out all trash. Do not burn or bury trash and food waste. </li>
    <li>Bury human waste in at least 6 inches or more of soil, at least 100 feet away from any lake, stream, water course or trail.</li>
</ul>",234956
106,SWIMMING,"<p>There are many places along the Klamath River to swim or play in the river.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Never swim alone or allow children to play unsupervised in creeks, rivers or lakes.</li>
    <li>Currents can be very swift and an innertube, air matterss or inflatible toy can be swept down river in a matter of seconds.</li>
    <li>There are numerous rapids, cascades and waterfalls along the river. The difficulty of the rapids changes with the seasons, the water levels and flow rates.</li>
    <li>Depth and temperature of the water changes daily.</li>
